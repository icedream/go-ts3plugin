# TeamSpeak 3 Client Plugin SDK

This is the official helper repository that contains example code and the SDK header files 
required to create native plugins for the TeamSpeak 3 Client.

## Getting Started

It's strongly recommended to build upon the test plugin. Plugins are required to export some 
special functions, which already exist in the test plugin. Optional functions may be removed 
if not used. See code comments for details.
